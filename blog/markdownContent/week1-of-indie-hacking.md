Honestly, I don't even know where to start. It's been a rough week, and after 10 days, all I did was this one thing : I integrated Google oAuth and the initial phase of an Instagram Login flow. I'm so much slower than I thought I would be, nevertheless, here's everything I've learned over the past week.

<br>

I learned the oAuth flow for Instagram's API. The goal is to build an app that allows people and businesses to grow without having their employees wasting their time navigating different platforms, customizing their captions, or even their content to suit certain kinds of audience in each specific platform. So I had to learn this API and how their authentication works.

<br>

In other words, it'll allow users to allow my app to access their data through Instagram and Google.

<br>

Then I also learned Next JS even deeper, I learned about route.ts files, protected routes, protected pages and private pages, where I should put my API keys, and components required for different pages of my application.

After hours of reading documentations, the project is starting to get a little bit clearer each day I hammer at it, even though I am very slow. With my sheer bias and arrogance added into the mix, I would ___boldly___ claim that the entire idea is becoming clearer, somewhere aorund 60%.

<br>

Yes, there are so many competitors out there, like Pallyyy, CrossPoster, and many more, but the goal is to build one where it is smart enough to replace an entire team. The goal is to serve marketing teams and up and coming influencers and content creators alleviate their pain from figuring out where they should post it, when they should post it, and how they would caption it.

<br>

I want to create a long term project that one day can be a content flywheel for those looking to build their own audience on social media. I do believe this is a unique project. I don't expect it to blow up and get me financial freedom, but I do believe that this is a project I can use to showcase my skills to my future employer, that I tried using a skill I learned to find and fix a problem people are facing.

Yeah, I agree, we're not all nerds here. So here are a few things I learned over the week; I have nothing going for me. I'm not like my friends out there who have a 9-5 stable income and a full time job at my age, I want to try something different. Sometimes, it feels like social norms and the discomfort of facing uncertainties alone because I choose to be different gets so heavy that I feel a quite unbearable amount of fear, doubt, and there's this sense of irresponsibility in trying this.

<br>

But there's a silver lining to it. I don't have nothing on me also means I have nothing to lose. I have nothing to be scared of, I can try, and fail, and I'll only be a little bit older than 26. It's scary, being this late in life.

<br>

2. No One Knows what it's like to be me. Everything that every single person around me thinks they know about me, is what they learn from seeing my outer shell. No one has ever lived in my head with me, no one knows what kind of thoughts I have, and how much I have doubted myself, no one knows why I do what I do and why I do it, no one knows why I work out hard, and no one knows why I take this risk when there are many safer ways to get to where I want to go.

<br>

BUT THIS... THE COST OF WANTING TO BE DIFFERENT. I have to constantly remind myself that I didn't choose this path to be the same as everyone, I don't want to live out my life in an office and watch the people I love slowly get older and not having the ability to do anything about it.

<br>

So the goal moving forward, is to keep going no matter how uncertain things can get, no matter how much competitors are succeeding in X and boasting about it.
