It's been a long year, and I did not end the year as how I hoped I would. And saying I fell short would be a major understatement. I missed my target by a lot. Metrics and numbers will be available down below at the bottom. First, we're closing out with stories and lessons learned.

There's Always a Silver Lining

One of the worst things of the year, was getting my license plates confiscated and getting fired all within a month. These 2 things humbled me so hard this year and the emotional roller coaster was like a truck, especially added on top of the fact that I'm a neurotic person.

<br>

What used to take 20-30 minutes to commute to work, now took 1 hour one way, and another back home. So the commute felt physically draining, I find myself feeling more tired before work just because of the commute so I drank more coffee. Because the classes I teach starts at around 3:00 PM, the caffeine addiction  really impacted my sleep schedule.

<br>

So for the 6 months where I had to take public transport got me into a spiral where my sleep is getting worse and I'm drinking coffee just to compensate for that.

<br>

I noticed after taking the bus and the MRT for 2 months, I'm starting to find it peaceful, and the bike just felt like a liability, due to the high maintenance cost, and I get to listen to podcasts along the way to work.

<br>

And now that I have my license plates back, I kinda miss taking public transport and being in the middle of it all, the jam-packed rush hour traffic, the crowdedness, and the busy of it all, somehow reminded me how productive we are as human beings. It encouraged me to do more, and to go above and beyond when teaching my students.

Your Mental Frame Matters
</h3>

<br>

I learned through this year that victim mentality is real. The circumstances that I end up in is my own fault, my inability to complete projects and follow through on my words, thus leading me in a financially not so good position after 1 year of trying is my own fault.

<br>

Not the lack of encouragement from the people around me, not because of the lack of motivation or sleep, simply due to laziness that I sometimes cover up and compensate for by telling other people that I'm tired and confirming that bias by looking at what I did that day which sometimes were the things I needed to do, and cannot be seen as a productive activity.

<br>

I learned this year that there is another side to this victimhood mentality. People are in terrible conditions all the time. And it's our obligation and our innate nature to want to work through it and get to somewhere better.

<br>

And sometimes it can be done with a simple switch. From thinking all the shit I had in the past defines who I am, into I survived all the shit I had in the past. I'm not a victim, but I'm  a survivor.

<br>

The power I got from this was immense.
