I saw a tweet the other day, it said the best time to try something new is yesterday. I don't know why, but it resonated today more than ever. There's always this notion where we have to be a certain type of person, have a certain trait for us to make it in a field where many fail. To be the one who makes it where others fail.

The Superstitions
</h1>

<br>

A question never goes away, and would often come to haunt me from time to time, I often ask myself ___will i make it?___ ___will I be able to make my parents not worry about me or my future?___

<br>

I do have dreams, aspirations, things I want to have, or do. I can clearly imagine the _the end goal_ but the amount of uncertainty I have to face overwhelms me from time to time. To put salt over the wound, there's always this notion or this idea where you have to be either :

<br>

A one in a million person, with a one in a million idea that you got from being born at the right country and the right family with the right parents with the right parenting methods and the right financial conditions that allows you to have the access to the exact right resources at the exactly right time, e.g. Bill Gates and Sam Altman for you ___TO MAKE IT___.

<br>

When I get slapped a few times, or even fail, at some really easy things that successful people wouldn't fail it, I run to these so called 'superstitions' as a way to cope and tell myself that it's okay. It's so engrained in my brain that there are people out there having a net worth of Billions of dollars, and make the amount of money I make per week every second, and they made it there easily, because they were at the right place at the right time. And it made me forgot that there are other people who went through the other side of the story and made it too.

The 'Stumblers'
</h1>

<br>

There are people out there, who are for some reason so invested into the things they do. They never give up, they don't quit after numerous amounts of failure, here's to mention a few of them:

<br>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Pieter Levels</h3>

Pieter Levels has failed numerous of times, he has launcehd 70 projects, and only 5 made money. He was depressed, and he did not like the general direction where his peers were going so he made something out of himself. He shipped 70 products, and only got a 6% winning rate. And now he is close to making $3M ARR.

<br>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold">J.K.Rowling</h3>

When she was at her lowest, J.K. Rowling contemplated suicide when she was an unemployed single mother. She was stuck in a terrible financial situation, and she had to rely on small welfare benefits to survive. But she never quit, despite the obstacles, despite being rejected by 12 publishers, she tried, and tried, and tried. J.K. Rowling loved what she did and she believed so much in it, she didn't 'pivot' or change strategies like startups in the business world did. She created something she believed in, and it worked, eventually.

<br>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold">R.A. Kartini</h3>

Kartini is an Indonesian historic figure. Kartini, though she passed away at the young age of 25 years old, has inspired other people especialy women to pursue formal education which was unavailable at the time in Indonesia. She always wanted to go study in the Netherlands, but unfortunately she was forced into marriage due to her cultural traditions. To show her eligibility to study abroadin a time where doing so was considered by her local culture to be rebellious, she did what she had to. From publishing writings and sneakily sending them to a writer she knew for years on end while hiding these messages in small snacks so her father and brother would not catch her, and finally got her scholarship to study abroad.

A Humbling Look At My Past
</h1>

<br>

With me trying to make things on my own, I always feel I'm part of those where I'm always at the right place at the right time. But lately, I've realized that I've never been more wrong in my life.

<br>

To name a few, I've failed quite some time in my life. I was benched and was not the first option in my junior high basketball team, I failed my 11th grade, I graduated from college with a terrible 3.02 GPA, I am finishing my Master's Degree education late. I can't help but feel that I'm always behind everyone else. I'm not the person who makes it in the first try, and wings it, and turns out to always make the right decisions. I'm the person who stumbles more than a regular human being, that I'll always fall, and fall, and fall. I'm not the lucky few.

<br>

I find it quite hard to remember. So here's how I'm going to fix it :

<br>

I'm going to add a page to this blog, if you look at my projects page, it will be filled with the things I've created, failed, success, not completed, validated, people buy it or not, it'll be there. With all the metrics and the amount of money I make.

<br>

___I want it to be a story of how I stumbled, how I kept going, and as a way that I can remember I never gave up.___
