Some days are good, and these days would look like lifting heavy in the gym, drinking tons of caffeine, getting work done, students I teach aren't that annoying at that particular day, what I did that exact day felt like some things that would later benefit my future.

Then some days are bad, and these days would look like lifting even heavier weights in the gym, drinking more caffeine, getting work done, students are a little bit annoying, and yes, I still did things that would benefit my future.

So what's the difference ?

<br>

Lately, things have been really rough. I discovered I had pneumonia due to a viral infection, I haven't been coding, and I haven't really been doing anything productive. I catch myself doom scrolling on YT and IG from time to time especially when life feels heavy at the shoulders.

<br>

And it's not rare that I catch myself sinking deeper into a hole, into a downward spiral, and being ashamed to admit it to my family, my girlfriend, and others.

<br>

I can't find the passion I need to pull myself back up, or even worse, the sense of responsibility. But I know I'm doing everything I need to be doing. I have a job, I have food and a place to live, and though these things can sometimes make me feel very happy and grateful about my life, it's not like that recently.

<br>

Well, that's me for now. But here's a bit of rainbow after the storm

Projects Progress
</h1>

<br>

I decided to build a fitness stockifier instead. Changes are already made and authentication, password storage, is already done. I'm currently building features that will be released to the beta project really soon. Front end, back, and database is all ready to work with one another. -- Can't wait to break it in prod :)

<br>

There are 3 main features, I've seen apps like Strava that people use to track their runs, and Strava has this feature where users can share their progress to Instagram with a click of a button. I want to do that too. I want to make that feature available where people can share their progress to social media with a tap of a button.

<br>

Then, users can also track their lifting habits, where there will be a tracker similar to github's green thingy tracker for each time a user goes to the gym.

<br>

Then the last would be a feature where users can compare their lifts to others with a chart. My app has the goal of letting lifters not feel lost when figuring themselves out in the fitness industry.

<br>

So yeah, beta release coming soon, project update coming soon as well.

<br>

But that's all for the past two weeks. Thanks for tuning in, and sorry for the late post, my health isn't cooperating with me lately.
